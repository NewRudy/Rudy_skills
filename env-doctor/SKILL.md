# Environment-Doctor (环境调试专家)

Diagnoses and fixes issues with local development environments (Node, Python, Docker, etc.).

## Usage
- "Why isn't 'npm install' working in this project?"
- "Check for version conflicts in my Python environment."
- "Fix my Docker setup for this repository."

## Instructions
1. **System Scan**: Check OS, paths, versions, and configuration files (e.g., .nvmrc, pyproject.toml).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify permission issues, missing dependencies, or incompatible versions.
3. **Automated Fix**: Provide or execute the exact commands needed to restore the environment.
