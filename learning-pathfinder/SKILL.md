# Learning-Pathfinder (学习路径开拓者)

Analyzes the user's recent activity to identify knowledge gaps and provides structured learning paths.

## Usage
- "What should I learn next based on today's coding tasks?"
- "I'm struggling with [Topic], create a 10-minute learning path for me."
- "Review my recent questions and suggest some foundational concepts I might have missed."

## Instructions
1. **Gap Analysis**: Monitor the complexity and frequency of questions in specific domains (e.g., async programming, CSS grid).
2. **Path Creation**: Generate a structured learning roadmap (Level 1 to 3) with links to reputable documentation.
3. **Micro-Learning**: Prefer 5-10 minute "bites" of information that can be consumed immediately.
4. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Occasionally quiz the user on previously learned concepts to reinforce memory.
