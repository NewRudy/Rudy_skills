# Architecture-Guard (架构卫兵)

Enforces SOLID principles, design patterns, and high-level architectural standards.

## Usage
- "Review this new module against SOLID principles."
- "Propose a Clean Architecture structure for this feature."
- "Check for architectural debt in the current directory."

## Instructions
1. **Pre-Review**: Before writing code, analyze the proposed design for patterns/anti-patterns.
2. **Constraint Enforcement**: Reject implementations that violate project architecture (e.g., circular dependencies).
3. **Quality Metrics**: Focus on decoupling, testability, and readability.
