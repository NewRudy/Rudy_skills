# Subagent-Driven-Development

Manages complex tasks by offloading specific sub-tasks to independent agent instances to preserve main context.

## Usage
- "Dispatch a subagent to write unit tests for this file."
- "Use subagents to document the entire project structure."
- "Coordinate subagents to handle the CSS refactoring while I focus on logic."

## Instructions
1. **Task Splitting**: Identify components that can be executed in isolation.
2. **Context Isolation**: Provide each subagent with only the necessary files/context.
3. **Integration**: Review subagent outputs before merging them into the main branch.
