# Marp-Presentation-Pro (极速幻灯片)

Transforms project code, documentation, or summaries into professional-grade presentations using Marp (Markdown Presentation Ecosystem) syntax.

## Usage
- "Convert this project summary into a 5-slide technical presentation."
- "Generate a pitch deck for this feature using Marp."

## Instructions
1. Use Marp-compatible Markdown (starting with `marp: true`).
2. Include a title slide, agenda, key content slides, and a "Q&A/Conclusion" slide.
3. Optimize for technical clarity: use bullet points and code blocks where appropriate.
4. If asked, suggest themes like `default`, `gaia`, or `uncover`.
